# Dog Breed Identification

## How to use our model

All the code required to run our model can be found in the flask folder. In the flask folder, you will find 3 folders named "images" followed by a number. These folders contain an image of a specific dog breed that you can use in our model. The reason we have individual folders with only one picture in each folder is because we encountered an issue when testing our model. When we had multiple images in a folder and we chose one of them to use on our model, the model would not work correctly.

### *Make sure to rename the folder you are using to "images" before accessing it and picking the photo to use on our model. The reason for this is that we have a specific directory that we use in our code.
